# Tech-Academy-Live-Python-Project
Simulated Team Work Environment

For the last nine days I participated in a simulated team work environment on a Django Python project. We were to each create our own web application all within the same master. Working within the same master was an excellent opportunity to learn version control systems, merging conflicts, migration conflicts and other team issues that you would come across in a working environment. We were alotted 2 weeks, 9 days as it spanned over the holiday Thanksgiving, to see how far we could make it through application construction stories. Each story progressively became more difficult in order to continue pushing our skills and problem solving mindset. I saw how a developer communicates and collaborates with their team in order to improve a product. I worked on the back-end and front-end of an application about plants, having a "green thumb" I felt right at home in creating something visually calming and appealing. I gained valuable real world experience that I intend to implement within my development career. 

Below are descriptions and examples of the work that I completed.
